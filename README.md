## Module Description

This Puppet module manages the resource of Google Cloud DNS.
You can manage its resources using standard Puppet DSL and the module will,
under the hood, ensure the state described will be reflected in the Google
Cloud Platform resources.

## Setup

To install this module on your Puppet Master (or Puppet Client/Agent), use the
Puppet module installer:

    puppet module install google-gdns

Optionally you can install support to _all_ Google Cloud Platform products at
once by installing our "bundle" [`google-cloud`][bundle-forge] module:

    puppet module install google-cloud

## Usage

### Credentials

All Google Cloud Platform modules use an unified authentication mechanism,
provided by the [`google-gauth`][] module. Don't worry, it is automatically
installed when you install this module.

```puppet
gauth_credential { 'mycred':
  path     => $cred_path, # e.g. '/home/nelsonjr/my_account.json'
  provider => serviceaccount,
  scopes   => [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/ndev.clouddns.readwrite',
  ],
}
```

Please refer to the [`google-gauth`][] module for further requirements, i.e.
required gems.

### Examples

### Classes

#### Public classes

* [`gdns_managed_zone`][]:
    A zone is a subtree of the DNS namespace under one administrative
    responsibility. A ManagedZone is a resource that represents a DNS zone
    hosted by the Cloud DNS service.
* [`gdns_project`][]:
    A project resource. The project is a top level container for resources
    including Cloud DNS ManagedZones.
* [`gdns_resource_record_set`][]:
    A single DNS record that exists on a domain name (i.e. in a managed zone).
    This record defines the information about the domain and where the
    domain / subdomains direct to.
    The record will include the domain/subdomain name, a type (i.e. A, AAA,
    CAA, MX, CNAME, NS, etc)

### About output only properties

Some fields are output-only. It means you cannot set them because they are
provided by the Google Cloud Platform. Yet they are still useful to ensure the
value the API is assigning (or has assigned in the past) is still the value you
expect.

For example in a DNS the name servers are assigned by the Google Cloud DNS
service. Checking these values once created is useful to make sure your upstream
and/or root DNS masters are in sync.  Or if you decide to use the object ID,
e.g. the VM unique ID, for billing purposes. If the VM gets deleted and
recreated it will have a different ID, despite the name being the same. If that
detail is important to you you can verify that the ID of the object did not
change by asserting it in the manifest.

### Parameters

#### `gdns_managed_zone`

A zone is a subtree of the DNS namespace under one administrative
responsibility. A ManagedZone is a resource that represents a DNS zone
hosted by the Cloud DNS service.


#### Example

```puppet
gdns_managed_zone { 'id-for-testzone-3-com':
  ensure      => present,
  name        => 'testzone-3-com',
  dns_name    => 'test.somewild-example.com.',
  description => 'Test Example Zone',
  project     => $project, # e.g. 'my-test-project'
  credential  => 'mycred',
}

```

## Development

### Automatically Generated Files

Some files in this package are automatically generated by
[Magic Modules][magic-modules].

We use a code compiler to produce this module in order to avoid repetitive tasks
and improve code quality. This means all Google Cloud Platform Puppet modules
use the same underlying authentication, logic, test generation, style checks,
etc.

Learn more about the way to change autogenerated files by reading the
[CONTRIBUTING.md][] file.

### Contributing

Contributions to this library are always welcome and highly encouraged.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md][] for more information on how to get
started.

### Running tests

This project contains tests for [rspec][], [rspec-puppet][] and [rubocop][] to
verify functionality. For detailed information on using these tools, please see
their respective documentation.

#### Testing quickstart: Ruby > 2.0.0

```

# An example Puppet manifest that creates a Google Cloud Computing DNS Managed
# Zone in a project.

# Getting Started
# ---------------
# The following example requires two environment variables to be set:
#     * cred_path - a path to a JSON service account file
#     * project - the name of your GCP project
#
# If running from the command line you can pass these via Facter:
#
#   FACTER_cred_path=/path/to/my/cred.json \
#   FACTER_project='my-test-project'
#       puppet apply examples/managed_zone.pp
#
# For convenience you optionally can add it to your ~/.bash_profile (or the
# respective .profile settings) environment:
#
#   export FACTER_cred_path=/path/to/my/cred.json
#   export FACTER_project='my-test-project'
#
# Authenticating to GCP
# ---------------------
# `gauth_credential` defines a credential to be used when communicating with
# Google Cloud Platform.
#
# For more information on the gauth_credential parameters and providers please
# refer to its detailed documentation at:
#
#   https://forge.puppet.com/google/gauth
#
gauth_credential { 'mycred':
  path     => $cred_path, # e.g. '/home/nelsonjr/my_account.json'
  provider => serviceaccount,
  scopes   => [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/ndev.clouddns.readwrite',
  ],
}

# Ensures a managed zone exists and has the correct values.
#
gdns_managed_zone { 'test-example-zone':
  ensure      => present,
  dns_name    => 'test.somewild-example.com.',
  description => 'Test Example Zone',

  # You can also set output-only values as well. Puppet will ignore the values
  # when creating the resource, but will assert that its value matches what you
  # specified.
  #
  # This important to ensure that, for example, the top-level registrar is using
  # the correct DNS server names. Although this can cause failures in a run from
  # a clean project, it is useful to ensure that there are no mismatches in the
  # different services.
